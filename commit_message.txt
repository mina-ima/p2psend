feat: Implement file chunking and basic flow control

This commit introduces significant improvements to the file transfer mechanism:
- Implemented file chunking for efficient handling of large files.
- Added basic flow control using `bufferedAmount` to prevent data channel overflow.
- Refactored incoming data handling into a common function (`handleIncomingData`).
- Added logic to skip duplicate chunks received, addressing a PeerJS behavior.
- Updated file selection to support multiple files.
- Corrected QR scanner data parsing to use `rawValue`.

This addresses the "ファイルチャンク化・転送処理の最適化" task,
and resolves issues with file reception and download.
